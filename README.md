This is a project developed for the Space App challenge (20 - 21 April 2013)

Project Overview
-------------------
Bad weather changes have been prevalent in most part of South Africa
Theses conditions have proven to be quite fatal especially in cities.
Bad weather conditions affect our daily living in the city. And just
by monitoring and developing a low cost platform to inform citizens
we can counter the negative effects of bad weather on our daily
activities

This project investigate the effect of bad weather in our daily activities 
and aim to build a low cost module to help citizens to be aware of weather
conditions at any time anywhere in the city and therefore plan their
traffic route more efficiently and in a greener way.

An Arduino based sensor system that captures temperatures, humidity, rainfall
intensity and carbon monoxide level.
